<!--
Exercise:

1. Use a while loop and jQuery to append each item in your recipe and your bucket list onto a web page.
2. Refactor your code such that the while loop lives inside a function called append_strings that takes an array as an input (argument)
3. Invoke append_strings twice, passing in recipe the first time and bucket_list the second time
4. Refactor append_strings such that it takes two arguments: an array of strings, and a string representing the CSS selector of the element into which the strings should be appended. (i.e. bucket_list may be appended into a #bucket_output div)
