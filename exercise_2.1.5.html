<!--
Exercise: Constructing sentences

1. Write a function called string_printer, that takes a string as an argument and uses $('#output').text() to place it into a specific <div> on the web page. Call it multiple times with different strings from the console.
2. Does string_printer use a side effect or a return value?
3. Write a function called funny_sentence that takes a noun, an adjective, a verb, and an adverb as inputs, and constructs a string of html text and uses $('#output').append() to place it on the page.
4. Put each word argument you pass in into spans that have css rules that styles them differently to make them stand out.
5. Invoke funny_sentence 5 times from within a <script> tag and see the result on the page.
Extra Credit: Create a version of funny_sentence that takes no inputs, but rather constructs a funny sentence on its own from randomly chosen words
